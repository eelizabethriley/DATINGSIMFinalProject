To begin, we have the user individualize the character in these intro sequences in GameLoop.java. Originally we had this sequence (where that player can pick a name, year, and house) in its own class but then we figured it'd be better to simply insert/modify it in the GameLoop.java. Then from that point, after all the user input is collected, the player is told the rules and placed in their house. In GameLoop.java, all the hashmaps for the player to move around in each location are at the bottom. We did this before it enabled the movement code to be less repetitive and universal in all the other class locations. In each location class (House.java,FordHall.java, and MendenhallCenter.java) there's a series of if/else statements that execute depending on the user input. We did this because it both simulates a real life dating simulator with a series of choices that the user can pick and the design ensures the user's choices matter. If an input meets a certain condition, the user gains/loses points, potentially gets objects in their inventory and even more options depending on each area. Each location has a gamePoints parameter to track the number of points the user is winning or losing. We did this so that it would track the current number of points consistently. Then at the final location at Mendenhall, the player has a 50/50 chance of winning over your crush because in life even if you do all the right things (and get a lot of points) love is still up to chance. This is done with math.random and if/else statements. Finally, we return back to the GameLoop.java. If the user has less than -50 points or +100, they lose or win the game and the while loop terminates. We choose this because it would allow the user to really explore the designated options for terminating.	

An alternative design that was considered at the very beginning was including everything in one class. While that would have made initial issues like how the inventory and points could be followed by the player moew easily, it strayed from the efficiency of object oriented programming. After some discussion, we were able to get things going in it's own individual class and fix the other issues we weren't sure how to tackle before. Additionally, we originally have a series of booleans for moving from location to location but we eventually switched to a hashmap which was much better.
